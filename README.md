# ZonesLevel

A lightweight Turtle WoW addon that displays the mouse hovered zone's level under its title on the world map.<br>
Inspired by [LevelRange-Turtle](https://github.com/Tenyar97/LevelRange-Turtle) created by Tenyar97, I prefer the level range of the zone under its title rather than in a tooltip.

### Manual installation
1. Download the [latest version](https://github.com/Arthur-Helias/ZonesLevel/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) of the addon.
2. Extract the archive.
3. Rename the folder from "ZonesLevel-master" to "ZonesLevel".
4. Copy the renamed folder into `WoW-Directory\Interface\AddOns`.
5. Enable the addon from the addons menu on the character selection screen.


## Compatibility
This addon was designed and tested for TurtleWoW. It should be compatible with any 1.12 client that does not add or modify zones.<br>
This addon should be compatible with any addon that does not also try to modify the zone's name at the top of your map. If any such incompatibility arrise, please feel free to report it through the `Issues` tab on this repository.<br>
Due to the lack of zone's IDs related API in 1.12 (as far as I'm aware), WoW clients using any other language than English might encounter issues. If any such issues arrise, please feel free to report it through the `Issues` tab on this repository.
